# Project

To simulate object collision behaviours in the physical world through modelling the interaction between the maze wall and the ball. The project aims to utilise computer graphics techniques to model the effects of gravitational forces acted on an object such as acceleration and bouncing off effect after collision. And discover methods for efficient collision detection computation.
